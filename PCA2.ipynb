    "What is a Projection? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of machine learning and statistics, projection refers to the process of transforming data points from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space. This is done by projecting the data points onto a set of axes that span the lower-dimensional space.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Centering the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The first step is to center the data by subtracting the mean of each feature from the dataset. This ensures that the data is centered around the origin in the feature space.\n",

    "Computing the Covariance Matrix:\n",

    "    The covariance matrix captures the relationships (covariance) between pairs of features in the dataset. It provides a measure of how much two features vary together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalue Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The covariance matrix is then decomposed into eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors represent the directions of the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the magnitude of variance along each principal component.\n",

    "Selecting Principal Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The principal components are selected based on the eigenvalues. Typically, the components with the largest eigenvalues are chosen, as they capture the most variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection onto Principal Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The original data is projected onto the selected principal components. This is done by multiplying the original data matrix with the matrix of eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. The result is a new dataset in a lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection in PCA is the process of transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space by projecting it onto the principal components, which are the directions that capture the most variance in the data. This process involves centering the data, computing the covariance matrix, performing eigenvalue decomposition, selecting the principal components, and projecting the data onto these components. The result is a simplified dataset that retains the most important information from the original data, making it easier to analyze and visualize."
